# ProjectEuler

### What is this?

This is a collection of solutions to the Project Euler problems in multiple languages.

### How?

By writing readable code and using as much of the language's tools as possible.
The code will be simple.
Writing modular, re-usable code is a practice for another day and is out-of-scope here.

### Why?

While others are interested in the math behind the problems, I'm not.
I'm interested in learning how to use a language to the full potential.
Performance will not be the focus, doing things as straight-forward as possible will.

### Multiple languages?

Being able to solve a problem using a tool (read: programming language) is good.
Being able to solve a problem using any tool is helpful.
Knowing what tool to pick to solve a problem is great.

Knowing what tool to pick comes from experience with those tools.
This repository is just that, me practicing with multiple tools.

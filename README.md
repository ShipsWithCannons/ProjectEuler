# ProjectEuler

### What is this?

This is a collection of solutions to the Project Euler problems in multiple languages.

### How?

By writing readable code and using as much of the language's tools as possible.
The code will be simple.
Writing modular, re-usable code is a practice for another day and is out-of-scope here.

### Why?

While others are interested in the math behind the problems, I'm not.
I'm interested in learning how to use a language to the full potential.
Performance will not be the focus, doing things as straight-forward as possible will.

### No comments? No explanation?

It's still Project Euler.
One of the joys from solving these challenges comes from solving the problem yourself.
While the code should be easy to follow it's left as an excercise to the reader why
I did it and why it's producing the correct results.
Don't you dare to write production code without comments when magic is happening!

### Multiple languages?

Being able to solve a problem using a tool (read: programming language) is good.
Being able to solve a problem using any tool is helpful.
Knowing what tool to pick to solve a problem is great.

Knowing what tool to pick comes from experience with those tools.
This repository is just that, me practicing with multiple tools.

# ProjectEuler

### What is this?

This is a collection of solutions to the Project Euler problems in multiple languages.

### How?

By writing readable code and using as much of the language's built-in tools as possible.

### Why?

While others are interested in the math behind the problems, I'm not.
I'm interested in learning how to use a language to the full potential.
Performance will not be the focus, doing things as straight-forward as possible will.
